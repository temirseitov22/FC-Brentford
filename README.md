# FC-Brentford
Football Club project

First I took English Premier League Players Data from https://fbref.com/en/

Then I exported them to Excel file and showed step by step work, from data cleaning to data preparing

Using prepared Excel file, I used it in Python and by analysis selected 21 player by posititons for main FC Brentford squad

After that I used current EPL football club Brentford and put all 21 selected players, then simulated 10 seasons with that squad and 10 seasons with original FC Brentford squad on FIFA 21
Using 10 simulated seasons results I created infographic with main highlights

EPL Players Data source: https://fbref.com/en/
All simulated seasons result I uploaded to GitHub under name Sim_#season
